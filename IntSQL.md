# For intermediate SQL Practitioners 

THE PREREQUISITES WOULD BE: 

1. Functions in SQL. You should know about aggregate and scalar functions, as well as built-in and user-defined functions.
2. Advanced commands. Questions may cover topics like joins, primary and foreign keys, indexes, and SQL relationships.
3. Database design. Expect questions on normalization, denormalization, and the differences between various SQL statements like DELETE, TRUNCATE, and DROP.
4. Advanced queries. You may be asked about subqueries, both nested and correlated, as well as how to perform specific tasks like finding the nth highest value in a column.

### `What are SQL operators?`

1. SQL operators are the special keywords or characters that perform specific operations. They are also used in SQL queries. These operators can be used within the WHERE clause of SQL commands. Based on the specified condition, SQL operators filter the data.
2. The SQL operators can be categorized into the following types:
3. Arithmetic Operators:For mathematical operations on numerical data

### `addition (+)`
### `subtraction (-)`
### `multiplication (*)`
### `division (/)`
### `remainder/modulus (%)`

### `Logical Operators:` For evaluating the expressions and returning results in True or False

1. ALL
2. AND
3. ANY
4. ISNULL
5. EXISTS
6. BETWEEN
7. IN
8. LIKE
9. NOT
10. OR
11. UNIQUE

### `Comparison Operators:` For comparisons of two values and checking whether they are the same or not

1. equal to (=)
2. not equal to (!= or <>)
3. less than (<),
4. greater than (>;)
5. less than or equal to (&<=)
6. greater than or equal to (>=)
7. not less than (!<)
8. not greater than (!>)

### `Bitwise Operators:` For bit manipulations between two expressions of integer type. It first performs the conversion of integers into binary bits and then applied operators

1. AND (& symbol)
2. OR (|, ^)
3. NOT (~)

### `Compound Operators:` For operations on a variable before setting the variable’s result to the operation’s result

1. Add equals (+=)
2. subtract equals (-=)
3. multiply equals (*=)
4. divide equals (/=)
5. modulo equals (%=)

1. Add equals (+=)
2. subtract equals (-=)
3. multiply equals (*=)
4. divide equals (/=)
5. modulo equals (%=)

### `String Operators:` For concatenation and pattern matching of strings

1. + (String concatenation)
2. += (String concatenation assignment)
3. % (Wildcard)
4. [] (Character(s) matches)
5. [^] (Character(s) not to match)
6. _ (Wildcard match one character)
